## MIDI to dual CV interface:

Based on : Core MIDI-To-CV

Simulates a duophonic keyboard sending 2 CVs / Vel / Gate (reTriggered) for Lower and Upper notes being played  
... if only one note is played Lower and Upper CVs are the same (Useful for unison / separate OSC with optional RingMod / Oscillator sync) 
There's also different options to retrigger Lower/Upper Gates independently.
